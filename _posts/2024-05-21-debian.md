## [PDL::Graphics::PLplot Packaging](https://joenio.me/tutorial-pacote-debian-parte2/)

I'm jumping to the second tutorial since I didn't have any big problems (that I can remember) during the first one. 

So, in this tutorial, the idea was to give us the experience of packaging a Debian, Perl-based library by actively doing it. I chose the PDL::Graphics::PLplot one, which is a Perl interface for the PLplot and already
has an open [Bug RFP #763203](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763203) requesting the Packaging, so I didn't need to create one.

The first 'difficulty' that I encountered was updating the copyrights, since different files had different authors and, therefore, I needed to add each files' information on `debian/copyright`. 

After that, everything ran smoothly until I checked `debian/control`and found a problem with an unpackaged dependency, `Alien::PLplot`, that, in their turn, also had an an unpackaged dependency, 
`Alien::Build::Plugin::Decode::SourceForge`. Of course, in the end, it also had an undocumented dependency, `Mojo::DOM58`.

```bash
brunalopes@brunalopes:~/package/libpdl-graphics-plplot-perl$ 
cme check dpkg-control debian/control

```

Since `Mojo::DOM58` didn't have any undocumented dependencies, I tried to pack it. I didn't have any particular problems with it. I opened a 
[ITP bug #1072018](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1072018.) and created a Salsa account, Now, I neet to wait to be accepted in the Debian Peral Group.
