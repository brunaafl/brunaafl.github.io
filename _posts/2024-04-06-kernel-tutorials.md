I've never had experience with virtual machines before, and at first glance, it seemed a bit dense and scary, but overall I think I had a nice learning curve over this process, it was not the smoothest one. Although the tutorials explain very nicely the goal, the commands and the meaning behind it, they do not go deeper into possible problems that may happen

I'm going to describe a bit each tutorial, and 

## [Use QEMU and libvirt to setup a Linux kernel test environment](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/qemu-libvirt-setup/)
 
I imagine it is better not to break your system while experimenting with kernel!

With that in mind, the purpose of this tutorial was to explain how to set up a virtual machine, i.e., an emulation of a computer inside your own machine, using QEMU and libvirt virtualization tools. This tutorial can be resumed in some major steps:

1) Getting the disk image for the VM, booting it with QEMU, and setting up libvirt to manage it.

  The biggest problem I had in this tutorial was with around 

2) With libvirt, set ssh connection

  Problems...   


## [Build the Linux kernel for ARM](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/build-linux-for-arm/)


Explain the idea of the tutorial


This was by far the tutorial I had the most trouble with, but mostly, because of some weird particularities of my machine.
