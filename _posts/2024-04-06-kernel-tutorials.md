I've never had experience with virtual machines before, and at first glance, it seemed a bit dense and scary, and although I had a nice learning curve over this process, it was not the smoothest one. The tutorials are very nicely explained 

# [Use QEMU and libvirt to setup a Linux kernel test environment](https://flusp.ime.usp.br/kernel/qemu-libvirt-setup/)
 
I imagine it is better not to break your system while experimenting with kernel!

With that in mind, the purpose of this tutorial was to explain how to set up a virtual machine, i.e., an emulation of a computer inside your own machine, using QEMU and libvirt virtualization tools. This tutorial can be resumed in some major steps:

1) Getting the disk image for the VM, booting it with QEMU, and setting up libvirt to manage it.

  Problems.....


2) With libvirt, set ssh connection

  Problems...

Explain the idea of the tutorial


This was definitely the tutorial I had the most trouble with, but mostly, because of some weird particularities of my machine.
