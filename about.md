# Some info 

Besides cs, I also like statistics (especially probability), physics, and neuroscience (!!!) a lot. I'm fascinated in understanding how the brain encodes and decodes information, and how we can use cs and mathematics as a tool to analyze, process, and study it. I'm also interested in Brain-Computer interfaces and generalization, Machine and Deep Learning, and signal processing.

My favorite deep-sky object is [NGC 4755](https://freestarcharts.com/ngc-4755), the Jewel Box!
